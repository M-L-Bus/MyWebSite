      Themes associated with <i>yuri</i> originate from Japanese lesbian fiction of the early twentieth century&#44 notably the writings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobuko_Yoshiya">Nobuko Yoshiya</a> and literature in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_S_(culture)">Class S genre</a>&#46
      Manga depicting female homoeroticism began to appear in the 1970s in the works of artists associated with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_24_Group">Year 24 Group</a>&#44 notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryoko_Yamagishi">Ryoko Yamagishi</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyoko_Ikeda">Riyoko Ikeda</a>. The genre gained wider popularity beginning in the 1990s&#59
      the founding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Shimai"><i>Yuri Shimai</i></a> in 2003 as the first manga magazine devoted exclusively to <i>yuri</i>&#44 followed by its successor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Yuri_Hime"><i>Comic Yuri Hime</i></a> in 2005&#44 led to the establishment of yuri as a discrete publishing genre and the creation of a <i>yuri</i> fan culture&#46

        As a genre, <i>yuri</i> does not inherently target a single gender demographic, unlike its male homoerotic counterparts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys%27_love">boys' love</a> (BL, marketed towards a female audience) and gay manga (marketed towards a gay male audience).
        Although <i>yuri</i> originated as a genre targeted towards a female audience, <i>yuri</i> works have been produced that target a male audience, as in manga from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Yuri_Hime"><i>Comic Yuri Hime</i></a>'s male-targeted sister magazine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Yuri_Hime_S"><i>Comic Yuri Hime S</i></a>.
